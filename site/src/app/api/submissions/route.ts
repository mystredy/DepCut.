// "New Submit" calls this to create a bare draft immediately — no body, no
// fields required yet. Every edit after that autosaves via PATCH
// /api/submissions/[id]; media uploads start on pick against this real id
// (see /api/submissions/[id]/assets/[type]/presign). Nothing here decides
// when the draft is "done" — that's the submit route.
//
// Capped at MAX_OPEN_DRAFTS unfinished drafts per user so someone can't spin
// up an unbounded number of empty rows — they have to finish or delete one
// first (DELETE /api/submissions/[id]).
//
// The editor's own Submit button sends { projectId }: the draft is linked to
// that project instead of the manual video/thumbnail/verification uploads —
// see submit-project's [id] page for how a linked draft renders. The project
// must belong to the caller; a stranger's id 404s rather than leaking whether
// it exists. Idempotent per project: a project can only ever have one open
// (draft) submission at a time, so clicking Submit again on a project that
// already has one continues that draft instead of creating a duplicate and
// silently eating a slot toward MAX_OPEN_DRAFTS.
//
// Artist-only. Everything downstream of a submission (its own routes, asset
// uploads) trusts ownership alone because a non-artist can never get a row
// created here in the first place.
