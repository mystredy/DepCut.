// Imports that are on screen before they are stored. A dropped file is probed
// from its own bytes and placed straight away; a stock tile or library clip is
// registered against its source URL. The copy into project storage runs here,
// behind the editor, and the asset swaps from the URL it arrived on to the
// stored one when the bytes land.
//
// Three things keep that honest:
// - Nothing about a pending asset reaches the saved document (see storedAssets
//   / docClips), so a tab that dies mid-upload leaves no broken reference.
// - Deleting a pending asset aborts its upload. A dropped file's claimed
//   object is never completed and is collected server-side; a remote copy
//   completes inside a single call, so one that lands after the asset is gone
//   is deleted here rather than left to count against the account.
// - A failed upload leaves the asset in place with an error, so the user can
//   retry it rather than discover later that it was never saved.
